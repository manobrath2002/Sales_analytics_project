# Sales_analytics_project
This project aims to create a dynamic, real-time dashboard in Power BI using the Adventure Works dataset. The solution integrates Python for data processing, MySQL for data storage, and Power BI for visualization with real-time updates.

Project Structure
1. Data Processing
Utilize Python and pandas to load and clean the Adventure Works dataset.
Perform tasks such as:
Handling missing values.
Normalizing data formats.
Ensuring consistency across datasets.
2. SQL Database Setup
Set up a MySQL database with well-structured tables (e.g., Product, Sales, Region).
Populate the database with cleaned data for efficient querying and storage.
3. Power BI Dashboard
Connect Power BI to the MySQL database.
Build an interactive dashboard featuring:
Key sales metrics.
Regional performance breakdown.
