# Sales_analytics_project
This project aims to create a dynamic, real-time dashboard in Power BI using the Adventure Works dataset. The solution integrates Python for data processing, MySQL for data storage, and Power BI for visualization with real-time updates.


## Project Structure  

### 1. Data Processing  
- Utilize **Python** and **pandas** to load and clean the Adventure Works dataset.  
- Perform tasks such as:  
  - Handling missing values.  
  - Normalizing data formats.  
  - Ensuring consistency across datasets.  

### 2. SQL Database Setup  
- Set up a **MySQL database** with well-structured tables (e.g., Product, Sales, Region).  
- Populate the database with cleaned data for efficient querying and storage.  

### 3. Power BI Dashboard  
- Connect **Power BI** to the **MySQL database**.  
- Build an interactive dashboard featuring:  
  - Key sales metrics.  
  - Regional performance breakdown.  
  - Target achievement visualizations.  

### 4. Real-Time Data Updates  
- Enable automatic data refresh in **Power BI** to reflect real-time changes from the MySQL database.  
- Configure updates either at regular intervals or based on SQL triggers.
